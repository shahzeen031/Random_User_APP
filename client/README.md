---

### The Situation

We are trying to build a simple React app that renders information retrieved from the [Random User API](https://randomuser.me/). Currently, we are calling the API on the frontend, inside of the `user.js` component. However, we would to make 2 changes:

1. Call the API from our mini Express.js backend using a new file.
2. Create the appropriate actions and reducers to retrieve the response from the previously created backend file. then, update the `user.js` component using that response.

The final implementation should result in the user being updated on page load by retrieving data from the backend file using Redux.
